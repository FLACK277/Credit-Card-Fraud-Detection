## 🧪 Methodology & Approach

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
   - Load the credit card dataset from Kaggle or custom CSV file
   - Examine basic statistics, data types, and class distribution
   - Check for missing values and data quality issues

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create pairplots to visualize relationships between all feature pairs
   - Generate boxplots to understand feature distributions by transaction class
   - Build correlation heatmaps to identify feature relationships and multicollinearity

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Split data into training and testing sets (80/20 split)
   - Apply feature scaling using StandardScaler for optimal model performance
   - Prepare data for machine learning algorithm consumption

4. **Model Building and Evaluation**:
   - Train five different classification models with default parameters
   - Evaluate each model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices
   - Select the best performing model based on comprehensive metrics

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Perform grid search optimization on the best performing model
   - Use cross-validation to ensure robust parameter selection
   - Re-evaluate the tuned model for improved performance

6. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Determine which features contribute most to accurate classification
   - Visualize feature importance rankings
   - Provide insights into biological significance of measurements

7. **Model Persistence and Prediction**:
   - Save the final optimized model for future use
   - Implement prediction function for classifying new credit card samples
   - Provide confidence scores and prediction probabilities
