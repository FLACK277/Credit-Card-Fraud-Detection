# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains a machine learning solution for credit card fraud detection using transaction data. The model aims to identify fraudulent credit card transactions while minimizing false positives.
# Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning in the financial security domain. This project tackles the problem of identifying fraudulent transactions in a dataset containing credit card transactions, where fraudulent cases are extremely rare (class imbalance problem).
# Dataset
The dataset contains credit card transactions with the following features:

Time: Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction
V1-V28: PCA-transformed features (for confidentiality)
Amount: Transaction amount
Class: Target variable (1 for fraud, 0 for legitimate)
